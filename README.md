How to run the web server:


Work process:
first we took the code from the react app and adjust what we need to prepare it to get information from the server.
At the same time we worked on the server to handle all requests. first we divided the server to MVC structure
and started handling the login logic, then the user and videos requests.
Then we start to combine the server model to extract information from the mongoDB.
